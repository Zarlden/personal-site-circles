# Personal-site-circles
See the hosted version here: https://damonlam.xyz/

## How I used the theme
Not the best web designer as of right now and randomly putting in circles around things seemed clumsy. So well I tried to make it the centerpiece of the website (even though it's not really a circle but more a radial. Close enough I suppose).

## Areas for improvement
- Work on my css animation to get everything nice, sparkly and _dynamic_ rather than *static*.
- Make the radial menu dynamic to accommodate adding new pages.
- More consistent theming across sites.
- The time taken to list the rest would probably be enough to fix them all.
